# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Name of your app** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Layout is optimized with the [ViewHolder](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView#improving-performance-with-the-viewholder-pattern) pattern.
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#configuring-picasso) for each image during loading.
* [x] Improved the user interface through styling and coloring.

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity or dialog fragment.
* [x] When viewing a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should show the full backdrop image as the layout.  Uses [Heterogenous ListViews](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Implementing-a-Heterogenous-ListView) or [Heterogenous RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) to show different layouts.
* [x] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
    * [x] Overlay a play icon for videos that can be played.
    * [x] More popular movies should start a separate activity that plays the video immediately.
    * [x] Less popular videos rely on the detail page should show ratings and a YouTube preview.
* [x] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Picasso transformations](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#other-transformations)
* [x] Replaced android-async-http network client with the popular [OkHttp](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-OkHttp) networking libraries.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Added CardView for each movie
* [x] Made Movie class Parcelable

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Using the `RatingBar` was a bit unintuitive. If the width leaves enough space for more than the maximum number of stars, then it will show all those stars, regardless of what number you set for the max (at least, that's what I encountered). Took some StackOverflow perusing before confirming this was the default behavior, and that I had to use `wrap_content` for the behavior that seems like it should be the default.
- I experienced lots of problems with the build not being able to resolve `AppCompat` and `CardView`. It turned out to be a bug in Gradle, and I ended up having to downgrade.
- I witnessed first-hand the terrible consequences of forgetting a field in a Parcelableâ€¦
- Adding the `YouTubeAndroidPlayerApi.jar` felt incredibly hack-y and was very time-consuming. It's unfortunate that the Android emulator is so much less performant than Genymotion's. When useful APIs like this are released, relying on a third-party emulator is a big drawback.
